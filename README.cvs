If you got the sources of source-highlight through the CVS repository,
please remember to run the following command before anything else:

	sh autogen.sh

This will run all the autotools in the correct order.  You should have
installed recent versions of automake, autoconf and libtool in order for this
to succeed.

Notice that you will also need Flex and Bison.
