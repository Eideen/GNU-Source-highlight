If you got the sources of source-highlight through the CVS repository,
please remember to run the following command before anything else:

	sh reconf

This will run all the autotools in the correct order.  You should have
installed recent versions of automake and autoconf in order for this
to succeed.

Notice that you will also need Flex and Bison.
