TODO list
=========

change the _doc, _nodoc, _css so that these definitions are part of only one file, instead
of having different files.

test for always flush (together with line number), and command line option

use <ol> lists and css for changing colors of lines,
see http://shiflett.org/code/highlight.php

normal = '\\("|\')' generates a failure

tests for .m4 files

shjs_css_transform.sh in share

background color in some .css in doc (for TODO)

the default ctags command line option should contain the
actual found ctags

line-range

CODE CLEANUP

the style file is always parsed even for output formats that don't need it...
but how to infer whether the style must be read or not?
IMPORTANT: this is crucial for output generation such as CSS that produces
elements with the class syntax: if that element is not in the style file that
element will be generated with class normal but this is not really correct...

GROUPS

also string def as StringDef

Is there an element class that is not a StateStartLangElem?

If allow for newlines (i.e., read the whole file) then also
split lines when formatting (for instance, for line numbers)

add a language element classname to avoid generate types as
keywords in some outputs (e.g., latex or texinfo) if black and white.
and allow also _ in classnames


check empty alternative in string def: "foo||" which would lead
to a non-terminating program

USE GENGETOPT DETAILS

recognize kde rc files
.ldif files

REFERENCES
----------
for output such as xhtml, since the style file definitions are not used
the noref is not used, and references are generated also for tags inside
comments.  Deprecate noref and use a keyword in the .lang file to avoid
generate references inside an environment/state?
