TODO list
=========

templates are not handled completely well (see tests/test_template.cc
and its output).  Actually this is due to possible ambiguities.

Use a class for printing errors

change the _doc, _nodoc, _css so that these definitions are part of only one file, instead
of having different files.

notfixed also for xhtml output.

avoid ctags tests if this is not installed.

test for always flush (together with line number), and command line option

in style file:
keyword2 like keyword
i.e., default a specific element to another one
if, then, the style is specified, this will override the default one
(possibily in another style file)

use <ol> lists and css for changing colors of lines,
see http://shiflett.org/code/highlight.php

normal = '\\("|\')' generates a failure

tests for .m4 files

pattern matching:
class,classname,inheritance = '(class) ([[:word:]]+) (extends)?'

Running ../src/source-highlight --gen-version --data-dir ../src/ --failsafe -i ./test.unknown -o test.unknown_out ... LEAKS! (this is the usual problem with flex scanner, that does not
seem to show when there's file inclusion...)

shjs_css_transform.sh in share

background color in some .css in doc (for TODO)

CODE CLEANUP

the style file is always parsed even for output formats that don't need it...
but how to infer whether the style must be read or not?

create generatormap externally from generator factory

instead of LineOutputGenerator, implement everything in OutputGenerator?
This would also allow to keep track of lines in OutputGenerator for
implementing line-range.
